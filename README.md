# SimpleMoneyApp

This is an app for tracking expenses, managing budgets, and tracking debt. I aim to keep it simple. (Temporary name, still under construction)

</div>

## Purpose

The purpose of this app is to practice my full-stack skills. I wanted something really simple to track my expenses. There are several alternatives out there, but I feel they are too much for what I need. So, I decided to start my own app for the desktop because I'm always in front of my computer. Instead of using my spreadsheet, I prefer to use something I built. I also wanted to experience what it's like to work with this kind of domain rules. If you want to use it, I'd be happy to hear your feedback.

## Features

- Create budgets
- Add transactions for the day, month, or any period
- Generate monthly reports
- Visualize budget expenses, transactions, and more
- Add debt amounts and link transactions to reduce or top up the initial amount

I think that is it. I'll add more if necessary.

## Design

I'm currently creating this app using a design I found on Dribbble created by [@Ajike Chimaobi](https://dribbble.com/shots/22698352-TrackIt-A-budget-tracker-web-app). I liked the idea because it is really simple and it corresponds pretty much with the idea of this project.

## Installation

```bash
$ nvm use v20
$ npm install && npm run dev
```
