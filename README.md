# SimpleMoneyApp (Temporary name we are under construction yet xd)

This is an app for tracking expenses, managing budgets and tracking debt. I try to keep this simple.

# What is the purpose of this?

The purpose of this is to practice my full stack skills and I wanted something really simple to track my expenses. There are several alternative out there that you can use for this matter but I really feel they are too much for what I need. So I decided to start my own app for desktop because I'm always in front of my computer and instead of using my spreadshet I prefer to use something I built. I wanted to experience what is like to work with this kind of domain rules. If you want to use it I'd be happy to hear your feedback.

# What are the features of this app

- Create budgets
- Add transactions of the day, month, whatever
- Have a report each month
- Visualize budget expense, transactions and so on.
- Add Debt amounts and link transactions to reduce or top up the initial amount

I think that is it I'll add more if needed.

# Design

I'm currently creating this app using a design I found on Dribble created by [@Ajike Chimaobi](https://dribbble.com/shots/22698352-TrackIt-A-budget-tracker-web-app). I liked the idea because it is really simple and it coherse pretty much with the idea of this project.

# Installation

```bash

$ nvm use v20
$ npm install && npm run dev

```
